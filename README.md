# List the things you added for points:

1- I added more passages, namely allowing the player to stroll down the beach, eventually leading them to being able to find a new item, the coral crown. I think my total number of passages is well over 8 now.

2- The coral crown item can allow the player a few more options within the game, allowing them to escape certain areas that would otherwise trap them if their tranquility stat is too high for example. The crown also opens up a new ending should the player seek it. The crown also adds variety in some text in the other endings. The player is also notified on whether or not they possess this item.

3- There is now a way to "upgrade" the coral crown. That upgrade is shown as the player having the "flower" variable. Since this setting doesn't have stats that work like a normal game, upgrading one of the items in place of upgrading a character's stats. By going down one of the paths, the option to present the coral crown before an alter will appear, this allows the player another route to one of the endings with some variation in the dialogue for that specified ending.

4- With that, there are many choices within the game that "upgrade" the players tranquility stat. Based on how high or low that stat is, certain choices may or may not be available to the player.

This game doesn't rely on the players stats, it does however restrict the player based on their level of "tranquility" (which is the only stat), possessing different items, or different versions of those items. All those things open up doors to different endings and different descriptions and dialogue.
